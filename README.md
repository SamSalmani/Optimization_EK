In this repository, Ensemble Kalman Inversion is used for optimization. In this method, firstly data related to ground motions called Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio is used in order to derive Shear Wave velocity profiles by performing optimization. For more details about the model performance, you can refer to "Albers, David J., et al. "Ensemble Kalman Methods With Constraints." arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.05668 (2019)".
